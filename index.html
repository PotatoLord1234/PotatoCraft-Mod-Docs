    <h2>About PotatoCraft</h2>
    <p>PotatoCraft is a branch of the unblocked game website <a
        href="https://sites.google.com/view/tripplethepotatoes">3XPotatoes</a>
      that is dedicated to developing an in-browser minecraft server based on Lax1Dude's <a
        href="https://eaglercraft.ru">Eaglercraft</a>. The goal is to provide a fun, interesting, inclusive enviornment
      for individuals to play on a unique and entertaining minecraft server, which can be accesable to many. PotatoCraft
      was released many times, the first development being an July of 2022, however, the server was not hosted on good
      hardware, and was not long-lived. There was then another attempt at reopening the server in August of 2022,
      however the server never got much traction, and wasn't good. For the third time now, there was a new plan. There
      was going to be a server hosted on much better specs and would provide a better and more entertaining experience,
      and until then there would be a temporary server to provide some entertainment. It was at this time that
      3XPotatoes had it's first wave of publicity, when it was featured in a tiktok with over 300k views. This blew up
      the temporary server to the point where there were 40-60 players online at a time, however this victory was short
      lived. The hardware failed on the temporary server, and interest was lost. Later that year, around late
      october/november, the new server was released, however this one was rushed, and was not hosted well either. There
      were also problems with accessability, like how people couldn't simply just join from the basic multiplayer tab.
      They had to directly put in the IP. This was a large problem, and in the long run, the server didn't last for more
      than 2 months, and only peaked at around 30 users. This enters to the lowest point of the server, where it was
      virtually nonexistant for well over 2 months. It seemed as if all hope was lost, when there was a new jolt of
      insporation to develop the server, and the newest creation began. This time though, the server would be hosted on
      top-teir hardware, and would not lack anything. This server would be on <a
        href="https://eaglercraft.ru">EaglercraftX</a>, which is minecraft version 1.8.8 in the browser, which comes
      with much more compatability compared to 1.5.2. This was a great discovery, and the new version of the server was
      born. After about 2 weeks of no progress with hosting, a breakthrough was made, which was able to revolutionise
      the way that the server was managed. The hosting would include a 4 core CPU and 24 gigabites of ram! After some
      minor problems were worked out, the server was able to be worked on, and by febuary break of 2023, the latest
      version of PotatoCraft was born. The server grew at a rapid pace, going from 30 average users online to 60 to 90
      in a matter of weeks. Everything was going great, and that brings us to the place we are now. PotatoCraft is a
      growing force in terms of EaglerCraft servers, and continues to expand every day.</p>

    <h2>Rules of PotatoCraft</h2>
    <p>Here, you can refer to the rules of PotatoCraft so you know what is and isn't allowed.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Everyone has the right to use PotatoCraft, regardless of race, sexual orientation, and gender. All users must
        be 13 years of age or older.</li>
      <li>Doxxing is against the rules, and supporting, being involved in, or anything relating to Doxxing is a bannable
        offence. Stop doxxing at (almost) all costs.</li>
      <li>Respect is key. Poking fun at eachother is fine, but any verbal abuse is not acceptable and can be punishable
        by a temporary ban (6 hours first offence, 3 days second) and a permaban on third strike.</li>
      <li>Hacked clients are not allowed. This includes dragon client, or anything of that kind. This includes X-Ray
        texture packs. First offence is a temp ban (1 week) and a ban on second offence. If the hacking is damaging the
